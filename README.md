### Work
- **Uber**: built a lot of things at related to money: payments on the mobile and web, in the Rider, Driver and Eats app. Worked on some of the high-load [distributed systems](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/) powering these products. The money systems handled more than $50B/year for more than 100M monthly users. Started as an engineer and I ended up managing a few teams later.
- **Skyscanner**: launched [Skyscanner TravelPro](https://www.travolution.com/articles/14875/skyscanner-takes-step-into-business-travel-with-travelpro): a coprorate travel booking solution. We signed up Transferwise and Skyscanner as customers, before realizing we did not hit product-market fit and shutting the service down. 
- **Skype / Microsoft**: built a few standlone Skype products: Skype for Xbox One, Skype for the web and integrating Skype into Outlook.com. Used by more than 400M people at the time. Also built Skype for Firefox OS, but we never launched this one.
- **JP Morgan**: built equity derivatives trading and marketing systems at JP Morgan.
- **Mobile apps**: was a profilic [Windows Phone developer](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2012/08/22/flowing-apps-with-developer-gergely-orosz/), building apps with over 15M downloads.

### Open Source
- Helped open source [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs), Uber's cross-platform mobile architecture framework. I did [some talks on RIBs](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/talks/#mobile-architecture-at-scale) as well.
- Co-built [SkyFloatingLabeTextField](https://github.com/Skyscanner/SkyFloatingLabelTextField), a Swift implementation of the "float label textfield".
- ðŸ’€ Open sourced [AdRotator](https://github.com/Adrotator/AdrotatorV2), a highly customizable ad rotation solution for Windows Phone and Windows 8. At its peak, close to 1,000 apps were using this component.
